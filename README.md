# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1: Network Port Scanning

# Task Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Cybersecurity Internship program. The objective was to scan my local network for open ports using Nmap and understand network exposure.

# Tools Used
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and discovery
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis (optional)
- **Git**: Version control

# Files Structure
- `scan-results/`: Contains Nmap scan results and analysis
- `screenshots/`: Visual evidence of scanning process
- `documentation/`: Detailed answers and learning notes

# Steps Performed #
1. Installed Nmap on my system
2. Identified local IP range (192.168.1.0/24)
3. Performed TCP SYN scan: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24`
4. Analyzed results and identified open ports
5. Researched services associated with discovered ports
6. Documented potential security risks

# Key Findings
- Discovered X devices on local network
- Identified Y open ports across all devices
- Common services found: SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
- Security recommendations documented in analysis

# Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience with network reconnaissance
- Understood TCP SYN scanning methodology
- Learned about port security and associated risks
- Developed documentation skills for cybersecurity tasks
